Question 2
R-CNN and Fast R-CNN: Candidate frames, which is generated by R-CNN, have a lot of overlaps and teh operation of feature extraction 
is redunant. However, Fast R-CNN normalizes the whole image and sends it directly to the deep learning networks, then to the 
candidate area extracted from the image. 
Fast R-CNN and Fast R-CNN: Faster R-CNN use Region Proposal Network(RPN) to replace the Selective Search used in fast R-CNN
